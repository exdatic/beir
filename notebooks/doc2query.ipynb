    "text = \"Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) is a treatment that requires light, a photosensitizing agent, and molecular oxygen. The photosensitizer is activated by light and it interacts with the oxygen that is present in the cellular microenvironment. The molecular oxygen is transformed into singlet oxygen, which is highly reactive and responsible for the cell death. Therefore, PS is an important element for the therapy happens, including its concentration. Curcumin is a natural photosensitizer and it has demonstrated its anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant effects that inhibit several signal transduction pathways. PDT vascular effects of curcumin at concentrations varying from 0.1 to 10 mM/cm and topical administration were investigated in a chick Chorioallantoic Membrane (CAM) model. The irradiation was performed at 450 nm, irradiance of 50 mW/cm during 10 min, delivering a total fluence of 30 J/cm. The vascular effect was followed after the application of curcumin, with images being obtained each 30 min in the first 3 h, 12 h, and 24 h. Those images were qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed with a MatLAB. Curcumin was expected to exhibit a vascular effect due to its angio-inhibitory effect. Using curcumin as photosensitizer, PDT induced a higher and faster vascular effect when compared to the use of this compound alone.\"\n",
