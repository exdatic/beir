       "  'text': 'Depressive disorder is one of the most widespread forms of mental disorders which lead to a significant public health concern, such as disability, suicide, and so on. Its etiology remains vague but it is believed that depressive disorder is a multifactorial disease which is induced by the interaction of social, psychological, and biological factors. Thus, there is no clear and definite pathological theory could illustrate its mechanism independently until now, involving genetics, neuroimaging, neuroinflammation, neuroendocrine, and others. Comprehensive assessment to patients with depression is the starting point for a right diagnosis. History-taking of physical condition is as important as psychiatric interview and rational usage of scales would be beneficial for screening. There are many kinds of therapeutic measures for depressive patients nowadays, including general intervention, pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, and physical therapy. For now, anti-depressants used in clinical practice is almost monoamine-based drugs while much more progress have been made in developing new antidepressant medications, like prototypical N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists, opioid agonists, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) receptors, and psychedelics. Once these novel drugs are proved to be practicable, it will create a historical evolution in the field of psychiatry. In addition, we advocate that measurement-based care (MBC) should run through the whole duration of treatment and goals of MBC in every stage are different. As brain projects in many countries are conducting in inspiring ways, we believe that our understanding about depressive disorder, of course, and other neuropsychiatric disorders will be better in the future.',\n",

       "  'text': 'BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of different nose types on the perception of facial aesthetics following camouflage treatment and orthognathic surgery for skeletal class II female patients.METHODS: A pre-treatment profile photograph of a skeletal class II adult patient was selected from the department archive. Two constructed photographs were created to represent orthognathic surgery and camouflage treatments with the aid of computer software. A total of 18 constructed images was composed using three profiles (pre-treatment, post-camouflage, and post-orthognathic surgery) and six nose types. These photographs were shown to the three groups (orthodontists, plastic surgeons, and lay people), and they were asked to assign an attractiveness score to each photo ranging from 0 to 100, with 0 indicating the least attractive and 100 indicating the most attractive.RESULTS: For the convex nose profiles, anterior movement of the mandible obtained by orthognathic surgery did not result in a significant change in the scores given by the lay people. When surgical or camouflage treatment was not implemented and, instead, just rhinoplasty was performed for these profiles, there was a significant increase in the aesthetic scores given by all groups. For the straight nose profiles, orthognathic surgery increased the attractiveness scores given by all groups. Furthermore, for all the profiles, extraction treatment did not affect the aesthetic scores given by any of the groups (P > 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: The lay people perceived that having a convex-bridged nose was a bigger problem than having a retrognathic profile. Overall, in terms of skeletal and dental orthodontic treatments, nose shape should be considered during the treatment planning process.',\n",

The DOR model was established by gavage of Tripterygium Glycosides (75 mg\\\\/kg) once daily for 14 days. Grain-moxibustion was applied to \\\\\"Shenshu\\\\\" (BL23) and \\\\\"Guanyuan\\\\\" (CV4) for 7 cones, 5 times a week for 4 weeks. The body weight and the ovary weight were recorded for calculating the ovarian index. The levels of serum anti-mullerian hormone (AMH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), estradiol (E2), androgen (T) and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) were detected by ELISA.RESULTS: After modeling, ovarian index and serum AMH levels were obviously decreased (P<0.05), and the levels of serum FSH, E2, T and DHEA were significantly increased in contrast with the control group (P<0.05). Following intervention and compared with the model group, the serum FSH and DHEA levels of each moxibustion group were significantly reduced (P<0.05), the AMH levels significantly increased and E2 and T contents significantly decreased in the moxibustion-2 and moxibustion-3 groups (P<0.05). The serum FSH, E2 and T contents in moxibustion-2 group were obviously lower than those of the moxibustion-1 and moxibustion-3 groups (P<0.05).CONCLUSION: Moxibustion pre-treatment can improve ovarian reserve function in DOR rats, while the effect is different with different intervention time, and the best intervention time is pre-occurrence and early stage of DOR.',\n",

EA (2 Hz\\\\/15 Hz, 2 mA) or moxibustion (46-48 ?) was applied to unilate-ral ST25 for 2 min. The IGP was detected by using a pressure-transducer and an amplifier before and after EA or moxibustion.RESULTS: Compared with pre-intervention, the IGP was significantly decreased after EA or moxibustion stimulation of both left and right ST25 (P<0.05). The IGP levels during 0-30 s and 30-60 s of EA stimulation of both left and right ST25 were significantly lower than those of moxibustion (P<0.05).

The subcutaneous induration, reaction points of emptiness-like feeling or pressing pain below the elbow- and knee-joints along the Large Intestine Meridian, Stomach Meridian and the Lung Meridian were inspected first, then re-examined by using heat-sensitized moxibustion method and a hand-held pain threshold tester (mechanical pressure), respectively. The frequency and coincidence rate of pressing-pain sensitive and heat-sensitive points were analyzed.RESULTS: In the 30 patients with allergic rhinitis, 10 positive reaction points as Kongzui (LU6), Chize (LU5), Hegu (LI4), Quchi (LI11), Shousanli(LI10), Zusanli (ST36), Shangjuxu (ST37), Fenglong (ST40), Xiajuxu (ST39), and non-acupoint of the Lung Meridian were found. Among them, the duration of heat-sensitive reaction in the LU6, LI10, ST37, ST40, and ST39 regions was obviously shorter in patients than in healthy subjects (P<0.01,P<0.005). The heat-sensitive forms of the positive reaction points were mainly heat transmission, heat-penetration and local reaction. The mechanical pain thresholds of the positive reaction points (LI4, LU6, LI10, LI11 and non-acupoint of the Lung Meridian) at the upper limbs and those (ST36, ST37 and ST40) at the lower limbs were evidently lower in patients than in healthy volunteer subjects (P<0.05). The pressure- and heat-sensitive acupoints were basically coincide in the patients, but being higher in patients than in healthy subjects in the frequency of occurrence. The mechanical pain threshold of the pressure-sensitive acupoints in patients was remarkably lower on the left side than on the right side of the upper limb, and obviously higher on the left side than on the right side of the lower limb (P<0.05). No significant differences were found between the right and left sides in the pain threshold in healthy subjects (P>0.05).CONCLUSION: There is a high overlap in the distribution of pressure- and heat-sensitive acupoints of the Lung, Large Intestine and Stomach meridians below the elbow and knee joints in patients with allergic rhinitis, and there is an imbalance between the left and right limbs in the mechanical pain threshold of the pressure- and heat-sensitive acupoints, but needing being further confirmed.',\n",

The DOR model was established by gavage of Tripterygium Glycosides (75 mg\\\\/kg) once daily for 14 days. Grain-moxibustion was applied to \\\\\"Shenshu\\\\\" (BL23) and \\\\\"Guanyuan\\\\\" (CV4) for 7 cones, 5 times a week for 4 weeks.

The levels of serum anti-mullerian hormone (AMH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), estradiol (E2), androgen (T) and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) were detected by ELISA.RESULTS: After modeling, ovarian index and serum AMH levels were obviously decreased (P<0.05), and the levels of serum FSH, E2, T and DHEA were significantly increased in contrast with the control group (P<0.05). Following intervention and compared with the model group, the serum FSH and DHEA levels of each moxibustion group were significantly reduced (P<0.05), the AMH levels significantly increased and E2 and T contents significantly decreased in the moxibustion-2 and moxibustion-3 groups (P<0.05).

Its etiology remains vague but it is believed that depressive disorder is a multifactorial disease which is induced by the interaction of social, psychological, and biological factors. Thus, there is no clear and definite pathological theory could illustrate its mechanism independently until now, involving genetics, neuroimaging, neuroinflammation, neuroendocrine, and others. Comprehensive assessment to patients with depression is the starting point for a right diagnosis. History-taking of physical condition is as important as psychiatric interview and rational usage of scales would be beneficial for screening. There are many kinds of therapeutic measures for depressive patients nowadays, including general intervention, pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, and physical therapy. For now, anti-depressants used in clinical practice is almost monoamine-based drugs while much more progress have been made in developing new antidepressant medications, like prototypical N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists, opioid agonists, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) receptors, and psychedelics. Once these novel drugs are proved to be practicable, it will create a historical evolution in the field of psychiatry. In addition, we advocate that measurement-based care (MBC) should run through the whole duration of treatment and goals of MBC in every stage are different. As brain projects in many countries are conducting in inspiring ways, we believe that our understanding about depressive disorder, of course, and other neuropsychiatric disorders will be better in the future.', 'pmid': '31784955', 'title': 'Introduction.'}\n",

Two constructed photographs were created to represent orthognathic surgery and camouflage treatments with the aid of computer software. A total of 18 constructed images was composed using three profiles (pre-treatment, post-camouflage, and post-orthognathic surgery) and six nose types. These photographs were shown to the three groups (orthodontists, plastic surgeons, and lay people), and they were asked to assign an attractiveness score to each photo ranging from 0 to 100, with 0 indicating the least attractive and 100 indicating the most attractive.RESULTS: For the convex nose profiles, anterior movement of the mandible obtained by orthognathic surgery did not result in a significant change in the scores given by the lay people. When surgical or camouflage treatment was not implemented and, instead, just rhinoplasty was performed for these profiles, there was a significant increase in the aesthetic scores given by all groups. For the straight nose profiles, orthognathic surgery increased the attractiveness scores given by all groups. Furthermore, for all the profiles, extraction treatment did not affect the aesthetic scores given by any of the groups (P > 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: The lay people perceived that having a convex-bridged nose was a bigger problem than having a retrognathic profile. Overall, in terms of skeletal and dental orthodontic treatments, nose shape should be considered during the treatment planning process.', 'pmid': '31788737', 'title': 'Effects of different nose types on class II treatments for female patients.'}\n",

The subcutaneous induration, reaction points of emptiness-like feeling or pressing pain below the elbow- and knee-joints along the Large Intestine Meridian, Stomach Meridian and the Lung Meridian were inspected first, then re-examined by using heat-sensitized moxibustion method and a hand-held pain threshold tester (mechanical pressure), respectively. The frequency and coincidence rate of pressing-pain sensitive and heat-sensitive points were analyzed.RESULTS: In the 30 patients with allergic rhinitis, 10 positive reaction points as Kongzui (LU6), Chize (LU5), Hegu (LI4), Quchi (LI11), Shousanli(LI10), Zusanli (ST36), Shangjuxu (ST37), Fenglong (ST40), Xiajuxu (ST39), and non-acupoint of the Lung Meridian were found. Among them, the duration of heat-sensitive reaction in the LU6, LI10, ST37, ST40, and ST39 regions was obviously shorter in patients than in healthy subjects (P<0.01,P<0.005). The heat-sensitive forms of the positive reaction points were mainly heat transmission, heat-penetration and local reaction. The mechanical pain thresholds of the positive reaction points (LI4, LU6, LI10, LI11 and non-acupoint of the Lung Meridian) at the upper limbs and those (ST36, ST37 and ST40) at the lower limbs were evidently lower in patients than in healthy volunteer subjects (P<0.05). The pressure- and heat-sensitive acupoints were basically coincide in the patients, but being higher in patients than in healthy subjects in the frequency of occurrence. The mechanical pain threshold of the pressure-sensitive acupoints in patients was remarkably lower on the left side than on the right side of the upper limb, and obviously higher on the left side than on the right side of the lower limb (P<0.05). No significant differences were found between the right and left sides in the pain threshold in healthy subjects (P>0.05).CONCLUSION: There is a high overlap in the distribution of pressure- and heat-sensitive acupoints of the Lung, Large Intestine and Stomach meridians below the elbow and knee joints in patients with allergic rhinitis, and there is an imbalance between the left and right limbs in the mechanical pain threshold of the pressure- and heat-sensitive acupoints, but needing being further confirmed.', 'pmid': '31777233', 'title': '[Analysis on the distribution of pressure- and heat-sensitive acupoints in patients with allergic rhinitis].'}\n",

The patients of the control group received basic treatment and oral administration of Cilostazol (50 mg/time, 2 times/d) and Epalrestat (50 mg/time, 3 times/d). The patients of the treatment group received acupuncture stimulation of Danzhong (CV17), Qihai (CV6), Pishu (BL20), Quchi (LI11), etc., for 30 min, once every day, on the basic treatment. The treatment was conducted for 8 successive weeks. The scores of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) symptoms, Toronto clinical scoring system (TCSS) and nerve conduction velocity (NCV) were detected before and after the treatment.RESULTS: After the treatment, the scores of TCM symptoms and TCSS were considerably decreased (P<0.05), and the NCV was significantly increased (P<0.05) in both groups compared with those of their own pre-treatment. The the-rapeutic effect of the treatment group was significantly superior to that of the control group in lowering the scores of TCM symptoms and TCSS, and in up-regulating the NCV (P<0.01).CONCLUSION: \"Buqi Yixue\" needling is effective in improving clinical symptoms and increasing NCV in patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy.', 'pmid': '31777234', 'title': '[Effect of \"Buqi Yixue\" needling on neurological function and nerve conduction velocity in patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy].'}\n",

With the same electroacupuncture prescription, the patients in the 5-time treatment group were given electroacupuncture once a day for 5 times in total, and those in the 10-time treatment group were given electroacupuncture once a day for 10 times in total, with an interval of 2 days between every 5 times of treatment. The two groups were compared in terms of cervical Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score and treatment score of cervical spondylosis before and after treatment, as well as whether and why the patients were willing to continue treatment after 5 times of treatment. The two groups were followed up to observe the recurrence of cervical spondylosis within 12 months.RESULTS: Both groups had significant improvements in cervical VAS score and treatment score of cervical spondylosis after treatment (P<0.05), and there were no significant differences in these scores between the two groups after treatment (P>0.05). There was also no significant difference in long-term recurrence between the two groups (P>0.05). Of the 30 patients in the 10-time treatment group, 21 (70%) showed no willingness to continue treatment after 5 times of treatment since they were satisfied with their treatment outcomes.CONCLUSION: Electroacupuncture can effectively improve the pain symptom of patients with cervical type cervical spondylosis, and compared with 5 times of electroacupuncture treatment, 10 times of electroacupuncture treatment may affect patients' compliance with clinical treatment.\", 'pmid': '31777235', 'title': '[Influence of different courses of electroacupuncture treatment on compliance and therapeutic outcome of patients with cervical type cervical spondylosis: a small-sample randomized controlled trial].'}\n",

The patients in the control group were given oral Estazolam tablets once a day, for successive 4 weeks. For patients of the treatment group, Zhongwan (CV12), Xiawan (CV10), Qihai (CV6), Guanyuan (CV4), Baihui (GV20), etc., were punctured with filiform needles for 30 min. The treatment was conducted three times per week for 4 successive weeks. The sleep quality (sleeping quality, falling asleep time, sleep duration, sleep efficiency, sleep disorders, hypnotic and daytime dysfunction, 0 to 21 points) was evaluated by using Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). The severity of insomnia (self-perception, sleep satisfaction, daytime function damage, sensibility change, and concern for sleep problems, 0 to 28 points) was assessed using insomnia severity index (ISI) score. The therapeutic effect was evaluated according to the PSQI score reduction rate = (pre-treatment PSQI score-post-treatment PSQI score)/pre-treatment PSQI score ?100%.RESULTS: After treatment, the total score of PSQI, ISI and the score of each item were all significantly reduced in the two groups relevant to their own pre-treatment (P<0.05). The total score, and scores of hypnotic and daytime dysfunction were significantly lower in the treatment group than in the control group (P<0.05). Of the 40 and 39 cases in the treatment and control groups, 5 (12.50%) and 4 (10.25%) were cured, 20 (50.00%) and 18 (46.15%) experienced marked improvement, 12 (30.00%) and 13 (33.33%) were effective, and 3 (7.50%) and 4 (10.25%) ineffective, with the total effective rate being 92.50% and 89.74%, respectively.

It concludes a main unit (power and control buttons) with newly designed specific output electrodes. Each of the output electrode is made up of two pieces of iron sheet containing magnet and can be firmly attached to the auricular concha and the corresponding site of dorsal auricle, respectively. The two iron sheets are separately connected to each of the output terminal of the main unit via two pieces of wire. This newly modified output electrode replaces the original wire clip, and solves the problems of easy loosening and easy injury of the original spring clip due to repeated usage, being simple, flexible and convenient in application.', 'pmid': '31777239', 'title': '[A modified device for transcutaneous electrical auricular concha stimulation in rats].'}\n",

This was demonstrated by direct inoculation and through cohabitation. Transmission by cohabitation was also demonstrated from inoculated freshwater Murray cod Maccullochella peelii to euryhaline Australian bass Macquaria novemaculeata and to marine silver sweep. The virus was also transmitted from infected marine silver sweep to euryhaline Australian bass and then to freshwater Murray cod. This study is the first to demonstrate the virulence of a megalocytivirus derived from ornamental fish in an Australian marine species and the first to show a feasible pathway for the exchange of megalocytiviruses between freshwater and marine finfish hosts.
